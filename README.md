# Photo Sharing Website

This was a class project in which we were required to learn a completely new framework on our own and develop a web application using this framework. We decided to learn how to use Ruby on Rails to develop an instagram-like website. 

*Unfortunately, due to the age of this class project, the code is no longer being hosted on an amazon server.*
